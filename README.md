# the-relation-between-two-dimensional-normal-distribution-and-coefficient-of-correlation
Simplified Chinese:
本代码是一个用于演示二维正态分布函数图像随相关系数ρ变化的变化情况简单的Matlab .m脚本。代码运行过程中，相关系数从-0.85到0.85逐渐变化，使二维正态分布函数图像也随之变化。
English(You can also think it as Chinglish)
This code is a simple Matlab .m script to show how the function graph of two dimensional normal distribution ranging by the change of the coefficient of correlation. When the code is running, the coefficient of correlation ranges from -0.85 to 0.85 gradually, which makes the function graph of two dimensional normal distribution also change.
